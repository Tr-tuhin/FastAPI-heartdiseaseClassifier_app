# 🚀FastAPI- Heart Disease Predictor

A machine learning API built with FastAPI that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health attributes.  
This project demonstrates **ML model deployment**, **containerization with Docker**, and **deployment readiness for cloud hosting (e.g., Render, AWS, etc.)**.
